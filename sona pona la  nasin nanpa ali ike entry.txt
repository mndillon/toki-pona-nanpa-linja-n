{{tp|nanpa-linja-n}} is a minimal decimal digit system for Toki Pona created by {{tok|jan Matun}}. It uses a single syllable word for each digit and is designed to make saying, hearing and understanding long sequences of decimal digits very natural.  "Say it the way you think it".

'''TL;DR:''' '''nanpa-linja-n'''
uses '''-n''' to clearly signal the end of numeric values:
* This works with Toki Pona syntax to enhance communication.
** Say "2010": "tun tasa wanon"
** Say "2000" followed by "10": "tun tasan wanon"
** Say "2001" followed by "0": "tun tasa wan non"
** Say "2001.0": "tun tasa wan pokala non"
** Say "243-555-0169": "tupowin pasa lululun pasan nowajunen"
** The '''-n''' is a phonetic marker, indicating the end of a digit sequence
** Screen readers can communicate larger numbers with less cognitive load
** Automated text-to-speech systems can communicate larger numbers with less cognitive load
* The speaker wants to communicate '''"1 2 3 4 5"''':
** for counting:
*** might say: '''"wan tun win pon lun"'''
** for the value 12,345:
*** might say: '''"watun tasa wipolun"'''
** for a sequence of digits, such as an ID:
*** might say: '''"watuwipolun"'''
** for emphasizing digits:
*** might say: '''"wan pasa tun pasa win pasa pon pasan lun"'''
** for breaking up long sequences with no change in value (pasa/pasan can be used anywhere):
*** might say: '''"watuwin pasan polun"'''
** In all cases the listener has understood the speaker as communicating '''"12345"'''
* Respects the speaker's freedom to choose how to express numbers:
** speaker says: '''"mute mute mute luka luka luka tu wan"'''
*** listener recognises additive '''pu''' style
*** listener understands: '''78'''
** speaker says: '''"peton"'''
*** listener recognises positional '''nanpa-linja-n''' style
*** listener understands: '''78'''
*** less cognitive load for anyone that is familiar with positional decimal descriptions of numbers
