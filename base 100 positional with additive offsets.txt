Short answer: there are no well-attested natural languages or traditional numeral systems that use an additive system and a true positional base-100 system.
But there are a few edge cases, partial systems, and historical proposals that come close to what you're asking for.

Below is the clearest breakdown.

✅ What you asked for

You want systems that have:

Additive numerals (numbers within a place or magnitude are created by adding units),

Positional structure,

With each position representing powers of 100 (i.e., base-100).

No known ancient or modern culture used base-100 positional notation in daily life.
However, there are relevant cases where 100 acts as a major grouping unit or where systems approach base-100 behavior.

🌍 1. Chinese & East Asian large-number groupings
Why it’s relevant:

East Asian numerals group by 10,000 (wan), 100,000,000 (yi), etc.
This creates something like base-10,000 positional blocks.
Within each block (0–9999), the numerals are purely additive-multiplicative, not positional.

How it compares to base-100:

The structure is:

[block][wan-block][yi-block] …

Each block acts like a positional digit, but the base isn’t 100 — it’s 10,000.

Still, it is one of the only cultures with a non-decimal higher-order “base.”

Conclusion:

✔ Positions exist, but the base is 10,000, not 100.

🌍 2. South Asian numbering system (Hindi, Bengali, etc.)

These languages use grouping units of:

100 (śata)

1,000 (sahasra)

100,000 (lakh)

10,000,000 (crore)

Numbers are built additively (e.g., “hundred five” = 105).

Why it's relevant:

“Hundred” serves as a major structural milestone, though not a true positional base.

Why it’s not base-100 positional:

The writing system (Indian numerals → Arabic numerals) is still decimal place-value.

“Hundred” is lexical, not positional.

Conclusion:

✖ Not positional.
✔ Uses “hundred” as a key additive building block.

🌍 3. Old Turkic / Mongolic large-number naming traditions

These systems use “hundred” (yüz) as a central additive component and sometimes combine into huge lexical units for large numbers.

But again:

✔ Additive within phrases

✖ Not positional at base 100

🌍 4. Hypothetical / invented / mathematical usage
Base-100 positional numerals do exist — but only in artificial systems, such as:

Hexadecimal (base-16) extended to “hexbytes” (base-256)

Computer-science base-100 or base-256 encodings

20th-century proposals for base-100 bookkeeping systems

These sometimes use additive internal structure for each “digit,” but they were never cultural or linguistic systems.

🌍 5. The closest natural precedent: Mayan vigesimal blocks

The Mayan system is:

Positional (base-20)

Digits are additive (bars = 5, dots = 1)

But 20, not 100, is the base, except for the second place (18×20) used for calendrical reasons.

This is the only major known system that is both positional and additive within digits — but not base-100.

❌ Is there any known culture that truly used base-100 positional numerals?

No.
No natural culture is known to have:

positional blocks of 1, 100, 10,000, 1,000,000, …

and additive digits.

This combination simply never arose historically because:

Base-10 and base-20 dominate worldwide.

Additive systems usually appear before positional ones, and the shift to positional almost always ended up being base-10 or base-20.

Base-100 requires a written symbol set large enough for 100 digits, which rarely emerged organically.
