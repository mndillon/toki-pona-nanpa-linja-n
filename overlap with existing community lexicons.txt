Digit words (from the spec):

0 non, 1 wan, 2 tun, 3 ton, 4 pon, 5 lun, 6 jun, 7 pen, 8 win, 9 nen

I’ll go through (1) phonotactics, (2) collisions with existing words, and (3) mutual distinctness.

1. Phonotactics check

All ten are CVN forms, which are fully valid Toki Pona syllables. The official grid of valid syllables includes exactly these shapes: non, wan, tun, ton, pon, lun, jun, pen, win, nen.

No ji, ti, wo, wu

No vowel clusters or weird consonant clusters

All stress on first syllable, which is trivial for one-syllable words

So purely phonotactically: 10/10 clean.

2. Collisions with Toki Pona vocabulary
1. wan

Already a core pu/ku word meaning “one, single, part”.
Wikipedia

Here it’s reused as the digit 1, which is actually semantically aligned.

Potential ambiguity:

jan wan = “one person / first person”

nanpa wan / nanpa-linja-n wan = digit 1

But that’s more polysemy than collision. TP already leans on context, so this is totally in-character.

👉 Verdict: Deliberate overlap, actually helpful.

2. non, tun, ton, pon, lun, nen, pen

As far as pu + ku go, none of these are official words.

Lipu-sona’s “creating unofficial words” page even lists non, nen, pen, pon, lun etc. as example free CVN syllables — i.e. syllables that are valid but not used by official vocabulary and often suggested as good raw material for new words.

So for the core language:

non – completely free

tun – completely free

ton – completely free

pon – completely free (close to pona but not identical)

lun – completely free

pen – completely free

nen – completely free

Any “close–sound” issues like pon vs pona, nen vs nena, are just normal minimal pairs — Toki Pona already has those (e.g. moku vs moli), so this isn’t special.

👉 Verdict: No direct pu/ku collisions; only normal-level similarity.

3. jun & win and nimisin territory

Here’s where it gets slightly spicy.

Community / nimisin resources have:

win as a non-pu word for “autism / neurodivergent / to stim”, tracked in linku’s sandbox.
nimi.li | Toki Pona Dictionary

jun appears in at least one fan dictionary as “hair, wool, fur, feather”.
tokima.neocities.org

Neither of these are pu or ku suli, but they do exist in some people’s mental lexicon.

So:

jan win could mean “neurodivergent person” or be read as “person eight” if someone is very number-brain in that moment.

soweli jun vs nanpa jun (digit 6) – possible double-take in a context where both numbers and nimisin are used.

This is not fatal, but:

In conservative “only pu/ku words” circles → no problem at all.

In “deep nimisin + nanpa-linja-n” circles → some soft semantics overlap you just have to live with.

👉 Verdict: Good in pu/ku world, mild squishiness in nimisin-heavy contexts. If you ever did want to tweak digits, 6 and 8 (jun & win) are the only ones with real community competition.

3. Distinctness inside the digit set

From a “how likely am I to mishear digits in a long string” standpoint:

Every digit is one syllable ending in -n → rhythmically very regular.

Within the set, no two digits share both consonant and vowel:

non / nen / wan / tun / ton / pon / lun / jun / pen / win

Closest pairs:

tun / ton – minimal vowel pair

non / nen – same consonant + different vowel

pen / pon – different vowel, same onset

TP vowels are pretty distinct, and there’s no banned / marginal syllable here (no ji/ti/wo/wu, no rare jo/lu/we/wi front-glide weirdness).

Plus the design deliberately avoids k, m, s in digit words so that things like pokala, kipisi, tasa/masa/wasa, pasa/pasan, sama sit in a separate acoustic “zone” from the digits.

 That’s really nice for parsing.

👉 Verdict: Internally, the set is solid and easy to keep apart, especially in longer sequences.

4. Overall judgement

Putting it all together:

Phonotactics: perfect CVN; no illegal or marginal syllables.

Collisions with official lexicon:

Only wan overlaps, and that’s intentional and semantically aligned.

The others are exactly the kind of unused CVN blocks guides recommend using.

Collisions with nimisin:

Real but limited overlap with win and jun in some subcommunities.

Mutual distinctness:

Digits are short, regular, cleanly separated from separators (k/s), and overall low collision risk.

So, in short:

The set is very well-designed for sound and collisions in pu/ku-land; the only nontrivial friction points are with nimisin “win” and “jun”, which matter only if you’re aiming for perfect coexistence with every unofficial word in circulation.
